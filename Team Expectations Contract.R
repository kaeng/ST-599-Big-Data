# GROUP EXPECTATIONS CONTRACT
#===============================

We will show up to meetings on time. If a conflict arises, we will inform another member 
of the team as soon as possible.

If we are having a difficult time completing our agreed upon task(s) before the next team 
meeting, we will discuss our difficulty with another team member and try to resolve it 
before the meeting.

Timely and clear communication. Respond to group emails within 24 hours, and if you know
you will be disconnected from email for an extended period of time, alert the group at least
24 hours before hand.

Read meeting minutes after each meeting once posted, especially if you were not able to
attend the group meeting.

Disagreements should be compromised civilly between group members. A group meeting should be
called if differences cannot be resolved.

Committed changes to the git hub should be done clearly - clean code and include comments,
name files appropriately, and save them in the proper folder/location if applicable.
