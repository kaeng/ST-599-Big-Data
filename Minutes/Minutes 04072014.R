#3) Proposed research questions, so far
  - Question 21: What is the annual payment for fire, hazard, and flood insurance on THIS property?

  * Does Oregon have higher / lower reported insurance coverage than California?
  (Even though we cannot compare the different types of insurance, total insurance payments can
   be compared.)


  - Question 11: At this house, apartment, or movile home - do you or any member of this household
  subscribe to the Internet using - dial up, DSL, cable modem, fiber optic, mobile broadband,
  satellite internet, other. (Each internet service method has a check box for yes/no, while "other"
  has a fill-in-the-blank.)

  * How is the proportion of respondants subscribing to dial-up, etc. methods change over time?
    (Oregon? Oregon vs. California?)
  

  - Question 14: Last month, what was the cost of ELECTRICITY for this house, apartment, or
  mobile home? (Dollar response, unless "included in rent fee" or "no charge or electricity
  not used" options sected.) Last month, what was the cost of GAS for this house, apartment, or
  mobile home? (Dollar response, unless "included in rent fee" or "included in electricity payment"
  or"no charge or electricity not used" options sected.)

  * How to electricity and gas costs compare? (Oregon? Oregon vs. California?)
  
  -Fangwu's questions
  Page 11. Question 48: person’s total income
  Aggregating question 48 for all persons of a household.
  
  * Is there any relationship between total household income and a collection of housing questions including Q.8 and 9 (P.5, Housing), Q.12 and 13 (P.6, Housing)? Regression?
  * Or is there any geographic patterns for these social determinants by using statistical tests (e.g. cluster analysis)?

  I’m not sure these questions are doable because most of questions are discrete values.
